# 🔮 Mystic Decision Wheel

A magical, physics-based spinning wheel to help indecisive friends make decisions. Built with modern web technologies and sprinkled with cosmic dust.

## ✨ Features

Atmospheric Design: Neon glassmorphism aesthetic with deep space backgrounds.

Physics-Based Spin: The wheel uses ease-out friction and simulated weight for a satisfying feel.

Procedural Audio: Generates its own sound effects (ticking, winning chimes) using the Web Audio API—no external MP3s required.

Battle Royale Mode: Optional mode that removes the winning choice after a spin, perfect for narrowing down options.

Mobile Responsive: Works perfectly on phones and desktops.

Zero Dependencies: Built with vanilla HTML5 Canvas and Tailwind CSS (via CDN). No build step required.

## 🚀 How to Use

Spin: Click "Cast to Fate" to spin the wheel.

Battle Mode: Toggle the skull switch to remove the winner after the spin.
