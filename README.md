# 🔮 Mystic Decision Tools

A magical, all-in-one decision-making toolkit to help indecisive friends find their path. Built with modern web technologies, realistic physics, and powered by Google Gemini AI.

## ✨ Features

🛠️ Three Mystical Tools

The Wheel of Fate: A physics-based spinning wheel for multiple choices. Features a "kicking" pointer and battle royale mode (elimination).

The Coin of Destiny: A realistic 3D coin toss with vertical flip physics and multi-layered metallic sound effects.

The Mystic 8-Ball: A classic fortune-telling ball with a shake animation and floating 3D answer reveal.

## 🧠 AI-Powered Sorcery (Gemini API)

The Sorcerer's List (Auto-Fill): Stuck on ideas? Type a topic (e.g., "Sci-Fi Movies"), and the AI instantly generates 6 creative options for the wheel.

The Oracle's Prophecy: After any result (wheel, coin, or ball), ask the Oracle why fate chose that option. The AI provides a cryptic, fun, and cosmic interpretation of the result.

## 🎨 Atmospheric Design

Deep Space Aesthetic: Neon glassmorphism UI with a starry, animated background.

Procedural Audio: Generates its own sound effects (ticking, ringing, thuds, magical chimes) using the Web Audio API—no external MP3s required.

Mobile Responsive: Works perfectly on phones and desktops with touch-friendly interactions.

## 🚀 How to Use

The Wheel

Enter Choices: Type options manually or use the Lightning Bolt ⚡ button to let AI generate them for you.

Spin: Click "Cast to Fate".

Battle Mode: Toggle the skull switch to remove the winner after the spin (great for narrowing down dinner options).

The Coin

Customize: Rename "Heads" and "Tails" if you want (e.g., "Pizza" vs "Burgers").

Flip: Click to toss the coin. It uses 3D rotation physics to land on a random side.

The 8-Ball

Focus: Concentrate on a Yes/No question.

Shake: Click to shake the ball and reveal your destiny.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

HTML5 Canvas: High-performance rendering for the wheel.
